# A runtime policy for the efficient execution of deep-learning workloads on heterogeneous edge platforms

This repository contains the essential code for the systematic characterization and experimental analysis of my thesis 
"A runtime policy for the efficient execution of deep-learning workloads on heterogeneous edge platforms"
It is divided into three main directories:
- `benchmark/`: legacy (as in the first, less versatile tool) benchmarking scripts, mainly for standalone execution.
- `policy/`: RTRM framework simulating the defined RTRM policy which can also be used as a benchmark script.
- `plot/`: (WIP) scripts for recreating the plots of my thesis.
